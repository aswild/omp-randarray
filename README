SUMMARY

    This is a basic OpenMP example which creates an array of random data using
    the glibc random_r() functions and print the execution time.

    The array size, number of threads, and initial seed can be specified on the
    command line.

    Optionally, (if <openssl/md5.h> is available) the MD5 hash of the generated
    data will be computed as a consistency check (mostly useful when specifying
    a seed)
